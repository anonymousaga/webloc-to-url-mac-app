# webloc-to-url-mac-app
A GUI Mac app that converts Mac-specific webloc files into equally-functional URL files that also work with windows.

Huge shout out to flagsoft/webloc2url for powering the main conversion of this app. The script inspired me to make an easier-to-use, GUI version of webloc to URL converter. Check out webloc2url here: https://github.com/flagsoft/webloc2url
